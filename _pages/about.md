I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the School of CS at Peking University advised by [Prof. Yun Liang](https://ericlyun.github.io/). 
Recently, I am visiting [SAMPL](https://sampl.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington and continue my research under the guidance of Professor [Luis Ceze](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~luisceze/).
My research interest is at high-performance computing for machine learning on emerging hardware accelerators, optimizing compiler design, and code generation. My recent publications investigate new algorithms, abstractions, and frameworks for efficient code generation on CPU and GPU. My research has been recognized with MICRO, ASPLOS, ISCA, HPCA, TPDS, and ICCAD. I received my B.S. degree in the department of Computer Intelligence Science at Peking University.
